Small C compiler, intended for systems with limited resources.
## Goal
The goal of this compiler is to provide a minimal C compiler capable of being used for normal C projects. It should be portable and compiled in multiple languages.
## Intention
This C compiler is intended to be embedded into other applications with minimal resource usage, with the main intent being to be able to run C code on embedded platforms and microcontrollers
